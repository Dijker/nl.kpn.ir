#KPN (Motorola) SetTopBox Infrared Remote app

This app enables Homey to send IR remote signals to your KPN SetTopBox. For now it is not possible to listen to signals of the remote.

Currently this app is in Beta. When you experience a bug or issue please report it on the Github page here: https://github.com/athombv/nl.kpn.ir/issues
